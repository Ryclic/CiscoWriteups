# Networking and Cyber Writeups
A collection of my networking and cybersecurity writeups as part of the Cisco classes I took, CCNP and Cyber.

These labs encompass the knowledge that allowed me to successfully pass these certifications:
- Cisco CCNA
- AWS Cloud Practitioner
- CCST Cybersecurity
- CompTIA Sec+

Classes and subjects are in their respective folders. Each folder may contain certain configuration files, in addition to the writeups.
